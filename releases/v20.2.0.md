### CockroachCloud

- Disaster Recovery of CockroachCloud Clusters

### Core features

These features are freely available in the core version and do not require an enterprise license.

Area | Feature | Description
-----|---------|------------
SQL | **Spatial Support** | CockroachDB now supports efficiently storing and querying spatial data via [spatial data types](../v20.2/spatial-data.html), [spatial indexes](../v20.2/spatial-indexes.html), and [spatial functions](../v20.2/functions-and-operators#spatial-functions), as well as the ability to migrating spatial data from various formats such as [Shapefiles](../v20.2/migrate-from-shapefiles), [GeoJSON](../v20.2/migrate-from-geojson), [GeoPackages](../v20.2/migrate-from-geopackage), and [OpenStreetMap](../v20.2/migrate-from-openstreetmap).
Recovery | **KMS for Encrypted Backups** | You can now use [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](../v20.2/take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html#use-aws-key-management-service) to encrypt the files that full or incremental backups generate.
Recovery | **Scheduled Backups** | You can now [create schedules for CockroachDB backups](../v20.2/manage-a-backup-schedule#create-a-new-backup-schedule), as well as [view, pause, resume, and drop backup schedules](../v20.2/manage-a-backup-schedule#view-and-control-the-backup-schedule). Once a scheduled backup is created, you can use [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v20.2/manage-a-backup-schedule#view-scheduled-backup-details) to view the backup details.   

### Enterprise features

These features require an [enterprise license](../v20.2/enterprise-licensing.html). Register for a 30-day trial license [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/), or consider testing enterprise features locally using the [`cockroach demo`](../v20.2/cockroach-demo.html) CLI command, which starts an in-memory CockroachDB cluster with a temporary enterprise license pre-loaded. [CockroachCloud clusters](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/) also include all enterprise features.
